This Game Dev Tycoon (created by Greenheart Games) mod was made on "UltimateModEditor" and required : 
- Game Dev Tycoon API
- UltimateLib

It add :
- 2 engine technologies (Cloud Gaming and Adaptive Engine)
- 2 technologies via the laboratories (like the previous ones)
- 1 dummy console

Both technologies require you to first search for "Hardware", "Internet Possibility" and "Codename: Grid".

I hope you will like it and don't hesitate to suggest additions.

v1.0 : Release of the mod.
